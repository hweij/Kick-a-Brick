# Kick-a-Brick Godot 4.1 VR demo project

This is a simple-as-possible demo for a Godot VR project.
I have used it to get familiar with programming VR with this game engine.

The "game" consists of a VR-scene, a player, and a brick wall that can be destroyed by lasering it
with your right-hand controller.

I have developed and tested it with Godot 4.1, Steam VR, and a PICO 4 headset.
